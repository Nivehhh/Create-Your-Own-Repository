# Create-Your-Own-Image-Classifier

Overview:
Train a deep learning model to classify 102 species of flowers, and use it in applications like a smartphone app that identifies flowers from photos.

Key Components:

1.Training the Model (train.py):
Basic Command: python train.py data_directory
Save checkpoint: --save_dir save_directory
Model architecture: Choose from alexnet, vgg16, or densenet121 (e.g., --arch "vgg16")
Hyperparameters: Set learning rate, hidden layers, epochs, and GPU usage (e.g., --learning_rate 0.001 --epochs 20 --gpu)

2.Prediction (predict.py):
Basic Command: python predict.py /path/to/image checkpoint.pth
Top K predictions: --top_k 3
Category mapping: --category_names cat_to_name.json
Use GPU: --gpu

3.Data Setup:
Your dataset should have train, validate, and test folders, each containing subfolders named by category numbers (corresponding to flower species).
Use a .json file to map numbers to flower names.

4.GPU Usage:
Training is resource-intensive, so use CUDA (for NVIDIA GPUs), cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud), or Google Colab (free GPUs) for faster training.

5.Hyperparameters:
Epochs: More epochs improve training accuracy but risk overfitting.
Learning Rate: A large learning rate may overshoot the optimal solution; smaller rates are slower but can lead to better accuracy.
Model Choice: DenseNet121 is more accurate but slower to train compared to AlexNet and VGG16.

6.Pre-Trained Model:For trained model (checkpoint.pth), use predict.py to make predictions on new images.
If you have a trained model (checkpoint.pth), use predict.py to make predictions on new images.
